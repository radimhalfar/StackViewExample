Explanation:
As you can see from the storyboard file, this is only a placeholder for static content.
All you need to do in order to use UIStackView inside the UIScrollView with static or dynamic set of elements
is to properly set the contentSize of UIStackView. There are multiple options how to set the content size.
I have chosen to refer to element which occurs onscreen, the top label.
